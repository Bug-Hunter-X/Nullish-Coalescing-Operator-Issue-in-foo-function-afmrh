# Nullish Coalescing Operator Issue in foo function

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to handling null or undefined values in function arguments. The `foo` function is expected to perform an operation on `a` and `b`, however, it does not handle null values correctly, causing unexpected behavior or errors depending on the operations within the function.

## Bug
The original `foo` function incorrectly handles null or undefined inputs. When either `a` or `b` is null, the function simply returns without performing any operations, potentially leading to silent failures or unexpected results. 

## Solution
The solution uses the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to provide default values for `a` and `b` when they are null or undefined. This ensures that the function always has valid input values to work with, preventing unexpected behavior.
